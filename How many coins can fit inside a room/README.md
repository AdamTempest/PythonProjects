# Born from Shower Thoughts

This progam was originally made to find out how many coins can fit inside a room.

Then, many thoughts surfaced one after another;
What if the coin is a box? What about a sphere coin?

What if the room is shaped like sphere? etc etc ...

And those questions lead to creation of this program.
